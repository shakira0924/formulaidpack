# FormulAid Package

`formulaid` is a Python package that takes inputs from the user pertaining to surfactant properties to narrow down the outputs (i.e. the surfactant choices) based on what the user desires to formulate. The extracted list of surfactant choices is currently limited to a .csv file included in the package's anatomy; but any list that is readable and correctly interpreted by Python can be used to use this package. It allows users to narrow down the vast availability of surfactants in the market based on the product to be developed. This package is designed mainly for experimentalists within the Complex Fluids & Soft Materials field.

## Features

- **Characteristic Property Search**: Search for surfactant key characteristics such as hydrophyllic-lipophilic balance (HLB), critical micelle concentration (CMC), type of surfactant, cloud point, state of matter, etc. in the provided list of surfactant choices.

## Installation

To install `formulaid`, run the following command in your terminal:
